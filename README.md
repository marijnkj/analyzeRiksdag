# analyzeRiksdag

- Multiple provinces: map with color of percentage voted yes
- Options: choose year, always download all data for regions and parties and give option to change visual based on region, party, gender
- Could look into finding context for agenda items so it's not just numerical points

- Collect list of available betecknings and categorize

Options to give:
- One year
- Agenda item (check how many this will give, perhaps needing to do a grouping)
- Download all parties, all members, rÃ¶st=Alla, svar=10000, ingen gruppering, json


Machine learning ideas:
- Finding similar buzz words in topics
- Analyze similar voting patterns -> perhaps to find similar groupings of topics
- Find alliances between parties
